# A program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order

x = str(input("Enter any phrase now: "))  

x_reversed = (x[::-2])
print(x_reversed)

# For example, the user enters: "I've seen it all now, a Rabbitte chasing a Fox around Croke Park!"
# The output then is: "!rPeoCdur o  nsh tibRa,o l ine vI"
