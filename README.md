Week 2 assignment - Calculating my Body Mass Index (BMI)
We create variables weight and height for user to input their data
we create variable BMI with formula BMI = weight/(height **2)
# Run the program first time - enter weight in kilograms 
# Run the program second time - enter height in metres 
# Run the program again to get the BMI result 
# If you want the end result as integer, formula for BMI will be BMI = (int(weight/height ** 2))
