Week 2 assignment - Calculating my Body Mass Index (BMI)
We create variables weight and height for user to input their data
we create variable BMI with formula BMI = weight/(height **2)
Run the program first time - enter weight in kilograms 
Run the program second time - enter height in metres 
Run the program again to get the BMI result 
If you want the end result as integer, formula for BMI will be BMI = (int(weight/height ** 2))


Week 3 - A program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order
x = str(input("Enter any phrase now: "))   # we create a variable for a user to input any phrase  
x_reversed = (x[::-2])                     # we use function to output every second letter in reversed order
print(x_reversed)
For example, the user enters: "I've seen it all now, a Rabbitte chasing a Fox around Croke Park!"
The output then is: "!rPeoCdur o  nsh tibRa,o l ine vI"
